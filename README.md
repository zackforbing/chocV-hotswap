# chocV-hotswap

# this is a work in progress. files are untested. use at your own risk!

This is a fork of the original board, adding a dual footprint hotswap/solder version. The edge cuts had to be modified to fit the hotswap pads, so it won't be compatible with any cases designed for the original. Bottom plate has not been generated, but may not work anyway with kailh sockets. I still need to compare pcb and socket thicknesses.

A 36 key choc keyboard based on the [Horizon](https://github.com/skarrmann/horizon) 
construction and a trimmed down [BabyV](https://www.instagram.com/eyeohdesigns/?hl=en) layout!

## Horizon + BabyV

The Horizon features a very unique and innovative construction and when I saw it, I knew 
I had to build one... but I've become really enamoured with the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku)
layout on my BabyV.  So I decided to mash them together and see what happens.  
Thus the chocV was born!

## Construction

[Skarrmann](https://github.com/skarrmann/horizon) has a wonderful description of 
the concept, but the main idea is to generate at least TWO pcb's for the keyboard.  One 
standard PCB with traces and all the components, and a second which bolts directly 
under with cutouts that match all the components on the first to protect them (and your 
desk) from damage.  This ends up creating a really tidy and very low profile board.

The specific footprints used and a plugin for KiCad to enable easy generation of the 
muiltiple PCB's can be found in the Horizon repo.  It's a very clever idea which is executed
exceptionally well.  All I did was re-arrange it a bit to get a layout I prefer.  I've added 
the KiCad files I generated in this repo as an example or jumping off point for others.

## Production

I used JLCPCB, as the original did, and the boards turned out great.  If you'd like to order a set of your own, the three gerber zip files are in the /gerbers folder.  You'll need one of each to
build a full board and I suggest you take a look through the Horizon repo to get a sense for 
the build process. 

I've built two complete boards, one based on the Elite-C to serve as a wired board and one 
built around a Nice:Nano for wireless functionality.

## Keymap / Layout

The Miryoku layout is what I use across all my boards.  It's very flexible and can be 
used/implemented on just about any physical layout.  I've used it on split boards mostly, but 
when I got the BabyV I feel like I really hit a sweet spot.  Splits are great, and they do 
feel better when I do a lot of typing, but the BabyV has a great sound, good looks, and 
monoblocks are just easier to manage on a desk... it might have a few too many keys, but 
nothing is perfect :-)

Miryoku has both a fully supported QMK build system and a work in progress system for ZMK.
If you are looking for a well thought-out minimalist layout, I can't recommend it enough.
